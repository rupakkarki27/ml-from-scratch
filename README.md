# ml-from-scratch
## This repo contains the code where I implement simple Machine Learning Algos from scratch

Machine Learning is not always about .fit and .predict.
To know more in-depth about the algorithms, the best way is to try and implement those algorithms from scratch with minimal use of third-party libraries.

*Note:* The implementations may not be perfect and may not be the fastest performing, these are meant to be for educational purposes.
